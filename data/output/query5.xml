    <title Title="How can I tell if a corpse is safe to eat?"/>
    <body Body="&lt;p&gt;I am a human wizard, and I just killed a monster, leaving a corpse on the ground. How do I tell whether it is safe to eat the corpse?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I left the monster unspecified because I am interested in &amp;quot;how can I figure out whether this is edible,&amp;quot; rather than whether any particular monster is edible. Likewise, I would prefer to avoid having to look up or memorize a list of every single monster (but rules for particular symbols are great).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;First off, no matter the corpse, never eat unless you just made that corpse or you have a method of preservation (tinning, icebox). Rotten corpses cause food poisoning (unless you're a fungus or a ghoul), and it doesn't take very long for a corpse to rot. And there isn't a visual indication of rotting, either, so the safe bet is to never eat something you didn't just kill. Most undead corpses are automatically rotten, as well. (See below for a more technical explanation.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the monster has poison or acid attacks, or is made of poison or acid, then there's a very high chance that you'll be poisoned or take acid damage. Both of these can be fatal, the former even instantly so, but poison and acid resistance will protect against this. Note that most poisonous corpses will chance to give you poison resistance, so this can be something to risk if you have enough health. Other elemental effects like fire, cold, and electricity are traditionally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the monster causes you to be stunned, hallucinating, or confused by natural attacks (as opposed to casting a spell), then it is highly likely you will be tripping after you eat its corpse. Some of these are very obvious. Actually, most creatures with negative effects like petrification will also carry over that effect with their corpse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it won't directly kill you, the corpses of teleporting creatures like imps, nymphs, tengu, and leprechauns will often give you &lt;a href=&quot;https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/430/my-character-keeps-jumping-around-in-nethack-why&quot;&gt;teleportitis&lt;/a&gt;. Note that tengu do have a chance of giving you teleport control, so it's a good idea to start eating those when you do get stuck with teleportitis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unless you are of the Caveman profession or the Orc race, you are not a cannibal. This means that eating a member of your own race will give you a penalty in the form of the &quot;Aggravate Monster&quot; intrinsic (which is as bad as it sounds) and a penalty to your Luck. This penalty will also show up for non-Caveman, non-Orcs when eating any domestic dogs and cats (the line of creatures you can get as a starting pet, generally). Horses are fine to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For specific exceptions, off the top of my head: &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;obolds are always poisonous but never grant resistant. &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;ats cause stunning. &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;raiths are safe to eat despite being undead. All adult &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;ragons are safe to eat, as well as most babies, but baby green dragons are poisonous unlike their adult counterpart. Lichen and Lizards do not rot over time and carry no negative effects that some other members of the same creature class might, so they make excellent backup food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rotting process is a little bit complicated and based on luck more than anything. Every 10 to 29 turns, a corpse gains a degree of rottenness. For a blessed corpse, 2 degrees are subtracted, while for a cursed one 2 degrees are added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it reaches a rottenness of 4, it is considered old. When you eat an old corpse, there's a 20% chance you will lose 1-8 hp, and a 1/7 chance of it being rotten (as in rotten food, not deadly.) When it reaches a rottenness of 6, it will give you fatal food poisoning, killing you in 11-19 turns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, put more simply, a corpse is definitely safe to eat in all cases for 32 turns, and it can cause food poisoning after a minimum of 48. Everything beyond that is just random chance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Undead corpses start out with an age of 100 turns, which is why they are almost always already rotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attributions for information provided within comments to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1410/willfulwizard&quot;&gt;WillfulWizard&lt;/a&gt; for reminding about teleporting monsters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/112/ire-and-curses&quot;&gt;ire_and_curses&lt;/a&gt; for corrections on non-rotting lizards and poisonous baby green dragons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/1234/kaestur-hakarl&quot;&gt;Kaestur Hakarl&lt;/a&gt;, who investigated and discovered the safe measures for cannibalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <body Body="&lt;p&gt;While trying to get 3 stars on the more complex levels (the ones with a lot of destructible entities) I noticed that even after playing the same level over 50 times, doing always the same thing, I've never seen the same final result.

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; is deterministic, but it's arguable that the overall result of launching a bird is &lt;em&gt;effectively non-deterministic&lt;/em&gt; because it relies on (extraordinarily sensitive) user input.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To test the algorithm and the effect user input has on it, I used the following procedure:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Load the Google Chrome version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrome.angrybirds.com/&quot;&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Load level 1-1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pull the mouse back to a specific X-Y coordinate.  (This was past the point of &quot;full draw&quot; for the bird.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Release the bird, and wait for the game to reach a steady state.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To measure my X-Y coordinate, I opened a background Chrome window, and navigated it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev-notes.com/code.php?q=33&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.  I aligned the two windows so that I could see the X and Y positions of the mouse while still able to cause something to happen when I released the bird.  I aligned my mouse cursor with the lower left hand corner of the box around these two numbers, and then released.  I noted the position of my mouse cursor then (as the display only updates when the mouse is not released and the cursor is over that window) and then noted the resulting score in Angry Birds.  If you're having issues with exact mouse positioning, you might try an accessibility option offered by your OS, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Use-Mouse-Keys-to-move-the-mouse-pointer&quot;&gt;Mouse Keys&lt;/a&gt; on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got the same score, so long as my cursor was in the &lt;em&gt;exact same spot&lt;/em&gt; as it was on previous iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to coming up with an enhanced test rig that allowed me to measure my cursor's position to the pixel,  I ran this experiment about 10 times, using a reference point in the background image of the game.  I got scores by firing the first bird that varied between 8,000 and 11,000 points.  Using the enhanced testing strategy, if I was off by a single pixel, I could expect score differences of anywhere between 150 and 500 points.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will note that the cursor was &lt;strong&gt;beyond the edge of the game area&lt;/strong&gt;, outside the browser window, far beyond the maximum distance the bird can be drawn back, and I still noticed differences when moving my cursor &lt;strong&gt;even a single pixel.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, I took screencaps for an extreme case where my cursor was on a &lt;em&gt;different monitor&lt;/em&gt; than the game window, and ran several iterations where I kept my cursor in the same location, or moved it slightly.  By my calculations (based on measuring distance from screencaps) the game was able to create a different result (score 32960 vs 31520) based on a one pixel difference in height (544 vs 545 pixels) over a distance of approximately 1,284 pixels of width.  This works out to be an angular difference of 0.03 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say that for any practical purposes, you can expect to employ the same general strategy on the same level repeatedly and expect wildly varying results.  The level of sensitivity in the controls is so extreme that there's no practical way to get it to do the same thing twice.  This is exacerbated by the fact that if you're playing on a touchscreen, it would be extraordinarily difficult to reproduce the same movements down to the individual pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

You don't want to be jumping up one block at a time all the way from your mine to your base.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <title Title="Where is the &quot;impossible space&quot; in Portal 2?"/>
    <body Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the commentary nodes by a &lt;em&gt;Portal 2&lt;/em&gt; developer, Eric Tams, said they used &amp;quot;world portals&amp;quot; to quickly reconfigure maps and puzzles during testing, which allowed them to create rooms that were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVAgyBOe84w&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;bigger on the inside&lt;/a&gt;, infinite falls, and other sorts of impossible geometry, save for the users own ASHPD space bending.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we started the project, making any big structural change in a level or the order of levels would lead to hours or even days of busy work trying to reconnect things and make sure they lined up again. If we ever wanted to ship something the size of Portal with the finely tuned balance we desired then we needed a way to be able to make big changes to the layout of the game without paying the cost of making everything line up again. We needed a way to bend space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soon every connection between any space was a portal. We would even switch them on the fly. Even a simple door worked like the cartoons - just a facade painted on a wall that seamlessly opened somewhere else entirely. Once the game settled down we were able to finalize our path and remove all of the world portals. There's only one impossible space left in the whole game. &lt;strong&gt;See if you can figure out where it is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the map layout was finalized, most of these were fixed into boring linear spaces, likely for the sake of performance, save for one spot.

This entity is exclusive to Portal 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is used in Chapter 9, in the Chamber 75 Death Trap with all the crap turrets. The room is actually completely separate from its supposed surroundings. It is the only use of this entity in the final version of the game, though commentary states that it was used a lot during the development of the title to link chambers together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess that the development team first made the rooms separate so that they could wipe a bad room, then connect them later when the levels were more perfect, and I suppose that this room didn't fit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Pictures&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the Death Trap that isn't connected to the other rooms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/tj5fi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/tj5fil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzwpL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;alternate view&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzwpLl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alternate view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Near the threshold and a tiny step (noclip fly) to either side:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/j9pRF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/j9pRFl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUJQU.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUJQUl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might want to skip the commentary and long walk and go to 04:30.

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;When you get killed by a decapitating strike, &lt;strong&gt;a flag gets set in the game state&lt;/strong&gt; to denote that an animation should be played showing that you got decapitated. Upon loading the game; the animation of the body appears to be overridden by another animation (eg. your character wobbles even though your standing still), so the flag does not affect the body part. However, it does affect the head...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see two ways to get rid of this annoying stuck flag:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;Get someone to do a decapitating strike on you without being in immortal mode.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;If lucky, the flag is removed upon death. If unlucky, it just adds and removes a second flag...&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The above fix won't work, once you get killed it will just reload the save game again. In a similar vein the other fixes mentioned in this question (and elsewhere) do not work because they do not clear the flag from the save game. Editing the save game seems to be a necessity to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get two save games, the one right before and after the incident. It might be more feasible to try to reproduce this and get two save games in which there are less changes...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, use Notepad++ to do a regular expression replace to change  &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you can use WinDiff and set it to show right-only lines. If done properly the amount of changes would be minimal and if you look at the lines containing &lt;code&gt;_var&lt;/code&gt; variables you could easily figure out which flag affects this. Replacing one character should yield the flag invalid, do however not add/remove characters as that might break the file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;"/>

You may dismember them in whatever grisly fashion you choose, any place, anywhere, any time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Begin Original Answer:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You cannot interact with Bunnies or Goldfish because the game treats them like NPC's. Therefore, you have two options for evil, wholesale slaughter!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lure an enemy into the bunnies!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slimes are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; aboveground during the day, and zombies are relentless at night. Though they will not seek out and destroy these fluffy friends, if you put yourself on the far side of one of the helpless NPCs, they will quickly decapitate them if they jump into the rabbits, or if the rabbits jump into &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; (in an impressive disregard for the laws of physics, I might add!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enemies may be 'coaxed' into following you by hitting them with a weak weapon, such as a wooden arrow shot from a wooden bow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you hear the &amp;quot;splotch&amp;quot; sound of something dying, or see numbers pop up on an otherwise dark part of your screen, it means that an enemy found its way into a critter on it's own. (If underwater, be sure to loot the dropped goldfish!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is one aspect of bunnies that may make this difficult, however; Bunnies only spawn in the 1/3 of the world nearest your spawn -- it is not inconceivable that the reduction in monster spawns (from your moved-in NPCs) makes it harder (if not downright impossible) to find a fiend to sick on your fuzzy hopper in the first place. If this is the case, perhaps you would prefer to...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use Lava!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If dwarf fortress has taught me anything, it's that magma solves everything.

(Try this trick on the Clothier too!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can use &lt;code&gt;Vile Powder&lt;/code&gt; to transform bunnies and goldfish into corrupt versions of their former selves. These incarnations can be slaughtered mercilessly as long as you like (or have corrupt animals to slaughter).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't forget your evil laugh; remember -- you can't spell slaughter without 'laughter'!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <title Title="Why do video game framerates need to be so much higher than TV and cinema framerates?"/>
    <body Body="&lt;p&gt;It seems that video games need to have something like 60 frames per second in order to be smooth and realistic. But TV and films only have about 24 or 25. Why the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;1. Responsiveness of input&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference in feel of the gameplay when input &amp;amp; response happen only 24 times per second vs. 60 times per second, especially for fast-paced games such as first person shooters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Network buffers and input buffers are filled on separate threads, which means new state from the game server, or button presses from your gamepad, must &lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt; until the next iteration in the game engine's &amp;quot;update loop&amp;quot;. This wait can be as long as 42 ms for 24 updates per second, while only 16 ms for 60 updates per second. That's a 26 ms difference or roughly 25% of the &amp;quot;lag&amp;quot; we experience on a 150 ms server connection vs. a 50 ms server connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2. Lack of physically accurate motion blur&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cameras in the real-world have what's called a shutter, which is open for a &lt;em&gt;continuous range of time&lt;/em&gt;, determined by the &amp;quot;shutter angle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;shutter speed&amp;quot;. For instance a moving picture captured at 24 frames per second might have the shutter open for 0.02083 seconds per frame (1/48 of a second, or 180° shutter angle). This continuous interval of time &lt;em&gt;captures and blends all motion&lt;/em&gt; happening therein, leading to what we see as motion blur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Games on the other hand, render only an &lt;em&gt;instantaneous moment of time&lt;/em&gt;. There is no equivalent interval where motion is recorded and blended, and instead you create what is essentially a crystal clear sample of the world at a particular instant -- something that is not possible in the real world. Because no motion is recorded in the rendered frame,  movement on-screen can look jerky unless the frame rate is increased to compensate (by capturing more inbetween motion). By increasing frame rate you essentially converge on real life &amp;quot;frame rates&amp;quot;, leaving us with the biological motion blur we get from our eyes (which are like shutters that are always open).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though modern games feature &amp;quot;motion blur&amp;quot; now, this only captures motion blur under certain assumptions, and does not (yet) fully recreate the motion blur we see in film or in high-quality CGI renderings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Demos&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For 15fps vs. 30fps vs. 60fps see &lt;a href=&quot;https://boallen.com/fps-compare-html5.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this demo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/2Ds7EcJ2Ia4?t=269&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;See also&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)#Latency_in_simulators_and_simulation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Latency in simulators and simulations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Motion Blur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Shutter speed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Popular belief among those of us who remember the original NES held that that blowing into an NES cartridge removed dust from the contacts, which allowed a better connection to the system.  In practice, the method was similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plug in cartridge, turn on system&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Curse when system does not work&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pull out cartridge, blow&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Re-seat cartridge, try system again&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a few cases, blowing may have actually removed dust, but the truth is that &lt;strong&gt;most of the time, what actually fixed the problem was the act of pulling the cartridge out and putting it back in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the original NES required you to put the cartridge in and then down, another common trick was to shove a second cartridge in the slot on top of the first one, which prevented the bottom (game) cartridge from slipping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Mental Floss has a detail analysis of the effects of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mentalfloss.com/article/12589/did-blowing-nintendo-cartridges-really-help&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;blowing in an NES cartridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <body Body="&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man#Perfect_play&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page for Pac-Man&lt;/a&gt;, the highest possible score is 3333360 points. It's called a perfect game and it was achieved by 3 different people already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I want to know is: &lt;strong&gt;WHY is it exactly 3333360 points?&lt;/strong&gt; It must be a technical limitation, but this number makes no sense in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know the game has 255 levels. 255 is &lt;code&gt;11111111&lt;/code&gt; in binary and level 256 (that seems to exist mystically) brings the 8-bit digit to an overflow, which ends in a crash of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, 3333360 just seems so random.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

And here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQBOKGQECHo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;video of some guy doing level 255 and 256&lt;/a&gt;, with important information regarding level 256.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Level 1 through 255&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating dots&lt;/strong&gt;: There are 240 regular dots per level, worth 10 points each, Netting 2400 points per level. Additionally, eating the four energizer dots, worth 50 points each, gives you another 200 points.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;Rightarrow; 255 &amp;times; 2600 = 663000&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating &quot;fruit&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: There is one edible object per level that only appears for a certain amount of time, twice per level. Depending on the type of fruit, which in turn depends on the level you are playing, you get a different amount of points. In total, you get&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;Rightarrow; 2 &amp;times; (100 + 300 + 2 &amp;times; 500 + 2 &amp;times; 700 + 2 &amp;times; 1000 + 2 &amp;times; 2000 + 2 &amp;times; 3000 + 243 &amp;times; 5000) =  2459600&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating Ghosts&lt;/strong&gt;: Eating a ghost in the same energizer period gives you 200 points, and double that for every additional ghost you eat (400, 800 and 1600 for the 2nd through 4th ghost, respectively). You can do this 4 times per level, but only up to level 16, and on level 18, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150423020915/http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html#LvlSpecs&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;since the ghosts don't blink in level 17 and 19+&lt;/a&gt; &#xA;&amp;Rightarrow; 4 &amp;times; 3000 &amp;times; 17 = 204000&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding these numbers yields &lt;strong&gt;3326600&lt;/strong&gt;, just &lt;strong&gt;6760&lt;/strong&gt; points short of perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Level 256&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This odd number can be gotten in the glitched-out level 256. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eo0NN.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a normal Pac-Man level&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/sDpyO.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a glitched Pac-Man level&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visible Dots&lt;/strong&gt;: As you can see, a bit more than half of the screen is missing, which means you can only get 112 normal and 2 energizer dots.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;Rightarrow; 1220&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Fruit&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the glitched screen, you can only get the key (the &quot;fruit&quot;) once&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;Rightarrow; 5000&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glitched Dots&lt;/strong&gt;: There are 9 normal dots in the glitched out region that reappear every time you die. At 5 extra lives, you can get them 6 times&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;Rightarrow; 6 &amp;times; 90 = 540&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Grand Total&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(663000 + 1220 + 540 (dots)) + (2459600 + 5000 (fruit)) + (204000 (ghosts)) = 3333360&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>
